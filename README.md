# Final_project
This repo includes code and data for analyzing the effect of voter turnout on the 2019 Canadian Federal Election. It was created by Amy Chen. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistical model that I built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly. I detail how to get that below. The sections of this repo are: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. We use two datasets:
- The 2019 Canadian Election Study â€“Online Collection. Retrieved from http://www.ces-eec.ca/.
- Census of Canada, 2016. Retrieved from the CHASS website.

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report and supporting material.
-ces_data.csv
-census_data.csv
-FinalProject.Rmd

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are:
- ces_cleaning.R
- census_cleaning.R
